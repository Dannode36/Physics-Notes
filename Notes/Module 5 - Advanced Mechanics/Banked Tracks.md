- Are essentially an inclined plane where the outside of the road surface is higher than the inside. This allows for objects to move around corners at higher speed.
- On a horizontal surface, an object relies much more on a sideways frictional force from the interaction between the tyres and road to maintain circular motion. On a banked corner, the Normal force can now contribute towards the sideways centripetal force

### Banked Corners
- From an engineering perspective, when designing roads we can find the angle at which there is no sideways frictional force. This is important as the car on the road will not drift at a certain speed. This speed is called the design speed.
- The design speed for a road is the speed at which drift is not occurring and is not necessarily the maximum speed.
- At design speed, the acting forces are now just gravity and the normal force. The net force that results, as per all centripetal acceleration, is directed towards the centre and is horizontal.

- To find the angle of the bank we can use the equation: $tan\theta = F_{net} / F_{g}$
- Depending on our known values given to us for a problem, we can manipulate the above equation for velocity:
	- $F_{net} = F_c = mv^2/r$
	- $F_g = mg$
	- Thus $tan\theta = mv^2/rmg$
	- $\theta = tan^{-1}(v^2/rg)$

- To find the velocity of the object moving on the bank when angle and weight are given, we can use the equation:
	- $v^2 = rgtan\theta$

### Worked Example
A curved end of a NASCAR track has a radius of 100m and is banked at an angle 40 degrees to the horizontal. The car has a mass of 1500kg.

1. Find the net force acting on the car
r = 100m
$\theta$ = 40$\degree$
m = 1500kg

$F_g = mg$
$F_g = 1500 \cdot 9.8$
$F_g = 14700$

$F_{net} = tan40 \cdot 14700$
$F_{net} = 12335N$ horizontally towards the centre

2. What is the design speed on this bank?
$v = \sqrt{rgtan\theta}$
$v = \sqrt{100\cdot 9.8 \cdot tan40}$
$v = 28.67ms^{-1}$

### Self Attempt
$F_{net} = tan\theta \cdot F_g$
$F_{net} = tan37\cdot mg$
$F_{net} = tan37\cdot 80 \cdot 9.8$
$F_{net} = 590.79N$ horizontally towards the centre

$v = \sqrt{rgtan\theta}$
$v = \sqrt{40\cdot 9.8 \cdot tan37}$
$v = 17.19ms^{-1}$
