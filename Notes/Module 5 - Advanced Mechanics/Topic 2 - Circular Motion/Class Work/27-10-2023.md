Circular Motion Questions:
1. Due to Newton's law of inertia, Phil was in fact not thrown back. Once the tram begins to accelerate, the force is not directly applied to Phil. Due to inertia, Phil will not move until a force is applied, therefore he would appear to fall backwards in the tram as he is held to the tram only by friction on his feet
2. $F_N$ and $F_g$ are not an action-reaction pair as $F_N$ is a contact force and $F_g$ is a non-contact force AND both forces are acting on the same object. The correct action-reaction pairs are $F_{CT}$ <-> $F_{TC}$ and $F_{EC}$ <-> $F_{CE}$
3. Friction (B)
4. If $f = 5Hz$ and $T = 1/f$ then $T = \frac{1}{5}$
5. Question 5 (3 Parts)
	1. A and D
	2. In the position shown in the diagram...
		1. Speed $= 8ms^{-1}$
		2. $V = 8ms^{-1}$ north
		3. $a_c=\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{8^2}{9.2} = 6.96ms^{-2}$ west
